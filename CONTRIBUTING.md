# So you want to contribute? That's awesome :smiley:

## Option 1 Contribute directly to Dicsovery

Dicsovery is an application to support security analysis using the Apparatus security framework. If you use the Apparatus framework and want to add more features to the tool, that's excellent news.

1. Make a fork. Play around with the code.
2. Run `npm run lint` to make sure the code follows [Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) coding style.
3. Make a Pull request.
4. If your pull request introduces a new dependency, make a note of it in your commit.

## Option 2 You like the tool and want to use it for own methodology or framework

Dicsovery was developed to support the Apparatus framework and I would prefer to keep it like that. Having said that Dicsovery was designed with modularity in mind. It is quite easy to replace the Apparatus specific concepts with concepts from another modeling language.

I would be more than happy to help anyone with the necessary changes.

If Dicsovery generates enough interest from the community, I will consider moving it to plugin based application. The core application will provide the underlying logic of the app while different modeling languages and frameworks will function as plugins. The plugins would be responsible for imposing the languages rules and analysis functions.

1. Make a fork. Play around with code.
2. Experiment.
3. If you have any issues, we would love to help.

Happy coding ðŸ˜‰
